# StockPrediction
For fun stock predictions NOT TO BE USED FOR DECIDING ON WHAT/WHEN TO BUY OR SELL EVER

Description on methods used to come! Currently just randomly picking a random element from an array of stock close - stock open,
and choosing that to be the next days change, and simulating many many times to find any trends. Currently plotting a floor and a ceiling of the estimates, along with actual price.
